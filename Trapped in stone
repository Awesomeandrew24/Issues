Hi I was playing wynncraft and decided to go to the spider dungeon.
So i just gave my key to the key collecter and then went to the darkness(blocks of coal)
and I teleported to the dungeon but one problem occurred, I spawned in stone
i am a mage with the teleport spell so I tryed teleporting but it just said "sorry you cant teleport... try moving away from blocks"
so then I tryed moving in every direction including jumping, so I had no teleport scrolls or anything like that so I'm trapped in stone.
If a admin could teleport me out of this stone that would be insanely great.
I also took a screen shot of whats going on if it helps the situation

My in game name is Awesomeandrew24 and i was playing my mage and I request that someone teleports me out or trades with me a teleport scroll to detlas or ragni
by the way I am using a texture pack if youre wondering
